Hi, I'm [Cliff Omanyo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cliff-omanyo-374449223/). I am a software developer and data analyst who hopes to become a data scientist and solve real-world problems and challenges. I enjoy playing video games 'casually' during my free time and identifying new technologies that may reinforce my prowess as a data scientist. I love cats 🐈.
